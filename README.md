**“WildLife.AI”**

Prelude

All successful initiatives/businesses stories start with a problem to solve. Here is one very deep and crucial for the mankind -"Conservation of wildlife".The conservation of wildlife is indeed a crucial aspect of our ecosystem, with far-reaching implications for both the natural world and human society. Many species are on the brink of extinction or have already disappeared, largely due to habitat destruction, climate change, poaching, and various human activities. To counter this trend, wildlife conservation efforts have gained momentum globally, and the incorporation of technology, especially machine learning and AI, has significantly enhanced these initiatives.

One notable organization in this field is wildlife.ai, a non-profit organization that leverages technology to aid wildlife conservation.
