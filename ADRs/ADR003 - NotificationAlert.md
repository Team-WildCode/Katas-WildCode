# Title: Notification Alert

## Context:
In a system where a camera is deployed, it is necessary to establish a mechanism for monitoring and managing its status. The camera is equipped with the capability to send periodic heartbeat status updates to the user through a mobile application. Additionally, the camera can interact with its software to fetch prediction metadata, enhancing its functionality.

## Decision:
Implementing a system that enables the camera to send periodic heartbeat status updates to the user via a mobile application and interact with the camera software to retrieve prediction metadata.

## Status:
Proposed

## Rationale:

1. **Real-time Monitoring**:
    - Periodic heartbeat status updates allow users to monitor the camera's health in real-time. This ensures that any issues or anomalies in the camera's functionality can be promptly identified and addressed.

2. **Proactive Issue Resolution**:
    - By receiving regular updates, users can proactively address potential problems, minimizing downtime and improving the overall reliability of the camera system.

3. **User Engagement** :
    - Sending status updates to a mobile application ensures that users are informed about the camera's condition without the need for manual checks. This enhances user engagement and provides a seamless experience.

4. **Predictive Metadata**:
    - The ability to interact with the camera software to fetch prediction metadata enhances the camera's functionality. This metadata can include information such as object recognition predictions, timestamps, and other relevant data, providing valuable insights to users.

5. **Scalability and Flexibility**:
    - This approach allows for scalability, as it can be adapted to different camera models and software configurations. It also provides flexibility for future enhancements and integrations.

6. **Security Considerations**:
    - Implementing secure communication protocols between the camera, mobile application, and software is crucial to protect sensitive information and ensure the integrity of the data exchanged.

7. **Integration with Existing Systems**:
    - Ensure that the proposed solution seamlessly integrates with existing camera systems and software, minimizing disruption to current operations.

## Consequences:

1. **Increased User Satisfaction**:
    - Users benefit from real-time updates, leading to increased satisfaction with the camera system's performance.
      
2. **Enhanced Functionality**:
    - The ability to fetch prediction metadata enriches the camera's functionality, making it more valuable for users.
      
3. **Maintenance Efficiencies**:
    - Proactive monitoring reduces the time and effort required for reactive maintenance, improving overall system efficiency.

4. **Data Privacy and Security Challenges**:
    - The implementation must address data privacy concerns and employ robust security measures to protect communication and sensitive information.

5. **Development and Integration Efforts**:
    - Development efforts will be required to implement the necessary communication protocols and integrate the system components.
